### Concept

***Back to Hell*** is a school project produced during one month in a team of 10 students. The objective was to create a 2D mobile game.
The game is a 2D platformer endless runner, it is played alone on mobile (only Android) in horizontal position with the thumbs.

### Rules



### Programming

Made with C# on Unity3D. Built for Android with the Android SDK, NDK and openJDK Unity modules.

## My contribution

It was the third project I made in a team but the first one we tried to make on the mobile platform, like for everyone too in the team. We were 5 programmers and 5 graphic artists. As a team of only programmers and graphic artists, none of us were sound designer. So I chose to take on the SFX work, using audacity to edit and mix already existing sounds. I came up with different sounds for the actions and skills of the player and enemies, interactions and UI audio feedbacks. That was an interesting experience, but not my favourite though.

/// SOUNDS to click ///

As a very first mobile developement experience, it was thus also the first I had with touch screen inputs. I learnt and use the Unity API's part for touch inputs for the first time. I implemented the input system for the touch controls to detect different touch movements on the same touch area. The two touch areas are the left and right side of the screen, where you use the thumbs.
